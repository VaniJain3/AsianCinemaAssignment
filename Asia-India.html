            Bollywood is one of the largest film industries in the world, producing around 1,500 films annually. It is known for its vibrant colors, extravagant dance sequences, and larger-than-life personalities. However, what is often overlooked is Bollywood's impact on the global diaspora, particularly in countries with large Indian populations, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and Australia.
The term "Bollywood diaspora" refers to the communities of people of Indian origin who live outside of India but have been influenced by Bollywood culture. These communities have unique subcultures and ways of interacting with Bollywood, from watching films in theaters to participating in Bollywood-inspired dance competitions.

"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" (DDLJ) is a 1995 romantic film directed by Aditya Chopra and starring Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol. The movie had a significant impact on the Bollywood diaspora and has become a cultural phenomenon.
Chaudhury Baldev Singh (Amrish Puri) feeds pigeons in Trafalgar Square while yearning for the green fields of "my land, my Punjab." This scene signifies his love for his "desh" or shows "patriotism" even though he is not there; his heart and soul are deeply attached to there. Song- "Ghar Aaja Pardesi; tera desh bulaye re" cements the fact more. He is shown as a character who, to secure his family's needs, moves abroad unwillingly and still romanticizes his life in Punjab and has deep-rooted cultural values.
The movie also popularized the "NRI" (Non-Resident Indian) character in Bollywood films. The story revolves around a young couple who fall in love while traveling through Europe and the challenges they face in trying to convince their traditional Indian parents to accept their relationship. This theme resonated with many NRIs struggling to balance their Indian heritage with their Western upbringing.
The iconic SRK Dialogue with Kajol in a hotel room cemented the NRI character where he focuses on the values and tradition of "Indian Woman" and being a "Hindustani" by heart, he will never hurt them. The keeping up of Indian values after shifting abroad was often shown in this genre of movies.
“main janta hun ki tum mere bare mein kya sochti ho. Tum samajhti ho ki main bahut hi ghatiya kism ka awara larka hun. Par main itna bhi gira hua nahi hun Simran. Main ek Hindustani hun aur main janta hun ki ek Hindustani larki ki izzat kya hoti hai. Main sapne mein bhi tumhare sath aisi harkat nahi kar sakta.”
Finally, DDLJ also had a significant impact on Indian society and culture. The movie's portrayal of a young, independent woman who challenges traditional gender roles was groundbreaking. It helped pave the way for more feminist themes in Bollywood movies. “Samira” in Ramji Chaley London portrays a similar female-lead who is shown as an Independent woman handling a business as an agent in an agency.
 
Bollywood films themselves have also had an impact on the diaspora. Many people of Indian origin who live outside of India see Bollywood films as a way to connect with their cultural roots. For example, the film "Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham" (2001) is known for its portrayal of traditional Indian family values, which resonates with many members of the diaspora who have grown up in Western societies. 
The film also had a significant impact on the international market. K3G was released in over 50 countries and was a commercial success in many of them. The film was particularly successful in the Middle East, where it became the highest-grossing Indian film of all time at the time of its release.
K3G also played an essential role in popularizing the concept of the "big fat Indian wedding" in the diaspora. The film's portrayal of grand weddings with lavish sets, designer clothes, and elaborate dance sequences became a trend that was emulated by many filmmakers in subsequent years. The festivals are shown on a grand scale, like the iconic Karwa Chauth scene taking place in the UK itself.

One of the most famous Bollywood movies that explore this theme is "Namastey London," which tells the story of a young British-born Indian woman who is forced to marry a traditional Indian man from Punjab. The movie shows the challenges of living in a new country, the clash between traditional and modern values, and the importance of cultural identity.
It showed the celebration of Indian festivals in the English capital of London, albeit in an almost unreal extravagant style. However, it broke some ground in showcasing a different side of NRIs to Indians. It showed they were not all about 'promiscuity' and 'spoilt-rich-brats.' 

The change in this perception of NRIs over the years, from 'villainous' and 'culturally bankrupt' to 'hardworking' and 'aspirational,' has been mainly due to the change India has been through. SRK here is shown obliging to his father's harsh order and still respecting him even though after moving to the UK, he still has his "values." Dichotomy in the representation of the 'good' and 'bad' son is often seen in K3G. This is also seen in the movie “Ramji Chaley London,” where the lead character Ramji goes to London to meet demands for his sister’s dowry. Even after spending a lot of time, he still is deep-rooted in values despite all the fame he got and is shown as a “good son” to his late father.

Following K3G was a succession of NRI-oriented movies that showed the foreign Indian community in a more favorable light. But these movies also made them seem invincible. 

The diasporic effect has been connected with “Bollywood Dreams” from old-age classics to modern storytelling. Old age classics like Purab aur Paschim (1970), Pardes (1997) and Lagaan (2001)  to modern era like Namastey London (2007), Chandni Chowk to China(2009)  and Ramji Chaley London (2005). 

Furthermore, Bollywood films have shaped perceptions of India and Indian culture in the West. While some argue that Bollywood films perpetuate stereotypes of India as a land of poverty and exoticism, others say they offer a window into Indian culture that might otherwise be inaccessible to Western audiences.

Despite these criticisms, the influence of Bollywood on the diaspora cannot be denied. Bollywood has provided a sense of community and connection for many members of the diaspora, particularly those who have struggled with issues of identity and belonging. As the global Indian population continues to grow, Bollywood's influence on the diaspora will likely continue to expand.
