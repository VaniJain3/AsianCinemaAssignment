            We talk about a rather interesting and buzzing topic today. While Rajamouli and the crew behind RRR crew is busy going award show to award show, and bringing widespread recognition towards home, things haven’t always been such for Tollywood. In my one year of staying in Hyderabad, I have tried to soak in as much of the local culture here as possible, the language, the people, the food of course, and my one of my favorite topics of interest, the cinema. And I have learned quite a bit, even though year is only enough to scratch the surface of this very diverse sphere of art. The common troupe of “South cinema is only physics defying action, and stupid plots” was the one that broke the first. Telugu cinema is a lot beyond that, and here, I’m talking about the mainstream.

 The best way to watch a Telugu film is not the way you’d watch a Hollywood film, or a movie that played at Sundance. If you go to the movies, you’re sitting alongside a crowd that bursts out in cheers every time Mahesh Babu comes into the frame, every time there’s a huge explosion as the hero walks out of it. At it’s core, Tollywood is very formulaic (at least was, till Rajamouli came to the scene to stir things up and giving it a whole new direction). </p>
 
 <p style="font-weight: bold;">*********************WHAT IS THE TOLLYWOOD FORMULA?**********************</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">So, let’s talk a bit more about this mainstream formula. There’s a Super Star who carries the box office, a love interest of the hero, a socio-political message, some banger hype songs and then action, a lot of action. The outline may seem like it would get repetitive, but it has been working for decades at this point, with new stars taking over, or the “OGs” continuing their legacy. Let’s dissect a very popular movie from 2013, starring none other than Prabhas, Mirchi.

So there you have it, Prabhas, the super star, Anushka Shetty playing her love interest. The film has a very clear message of non-violence and ending enmity, with smaller messages like respecting women, not being greedy, keeping family values intact, with commentary on social hierarchy as well. I choose to talk about this film, because its scenes constantly depict things very opposite to its messages. There is a lot of violence one may call unnecessary, oversexualizing of women, and jokes in the film always accompanied by innuendo. This seems to oppose everything that the film stands for. But my understanding of it was, these troupes become necessary to bring audience in the cinema halls, and when they leave, they leave with a positive social message. Telugu films do not hesitate at having a non-neutral political narrative. The troupes become necessary to reach the eyes the filmmakers are set to target. 

The formula is far from the majorities of Hollywood and Bollywood cinema, yet has been embraced by the entire industry. A concept built around an audience and culture. Though, there have been attempts to experiment, and integrate trends from Hollywood and North Indian cinema, seldom seeing acceptance in the eyes of the fans. But art is ever evolving, as are the artists, generation by generation. Bringing us to the man that challenged everything that mainstream Tollywood stood for, and came out the other end successfully making a mark with his work. The man, being S.S. Rajamouli himself.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">**************************THE RAJAMOULI REVOLUTION**************************</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">The rebel star behind the camera, Rajamouli brought to the South India what many had tried, but never succeeded. Though the fantasy genre had made appearances earlier in Tollywood cinema in form of mythology narratives, never had Tollywood witnessed fantasy with the spectacle that Rajamouli brought to the silver screen. With Bahubali breaking box office charts, a new gold was discovered. Bahubali brought huge technological advancements, from VFX, to stunts, and majestic set pieces, it redefined action, drama, and storytelling as a whole. Many followed the footsteps of Bahubali, some seeing success; Magadheera for example. Bahubali, and its sequel did see a wide acclaim worldwide, but it was RRR that set the benchmark. The new formula changed to bringing the Hollywood spectacle and Indianizing it. Referencing to Hindu mythology, worshipping rituals and Indian values is still prevalent, in RRR, for example where the protagonist is depicted as Lord Rama from Hindu mythology. These Indianizing trends do affect reception from foreign critics, but the sheer uniqueness and tonal shifts in the films (due to music sequences, melodramatic scenes, and exaggeration in action) seem to grab the most attention.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold";>*********************************CONCLUSION*********************************</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Where does Tollywood go from here? With younger generations entering the scene, and with the taste of the audiences shifting towards the west, Tollywood, a very audience centric media industry, has no option but to stay as dynamic as the eyes they seek to please. Storytelling is becoming more refined, with some troupes exiting the mainstream. The westernization may slowly be ending the aspects that were unique to the Telugu film scene, but the direction being positive or not cannot be judged without being biased. Let’s just say it’s entering a new phase under the global attention.
